#Round1 -> 23 Nov 11AM

started with introduction, he was very convinced with my introduction and kept telling me that i have good profile for leetcode
then asked me about my projects and i explained it well.
then started with 1st question

1. We are given a 2d matrix m*n , and it has 0s and 1s, 1 means there is a node and it can communicate with other node if there is a node in same row or column as this node, and if it can communicate, it means it is a server (if there is no other 1 on same row or column, then it is not a server). Count no. of servers in the matrix
=> Took me long to even understand the question and hence i thought it is a graph question, then i gave him a brute force solution which would be checking for every node and then horizontally checking if there is any other node in same row or column, complexity => O(n*m*(n+m))
=> then I had to code it and he couldn't understand how my code was working and made me dry run it on 5 test cases and it took almost 40 mins
=> then he was convinced and i gave verbally told him other approach using map and storing nodes in each row and column and checking => complexity => O(n*m) time , O(n+m) space

Then he gave me another question

2. https://leetcode.com/problems/backspace-string-compare

=> took me 3 mins to explain the approach and then 2 min to code it, overall after dry run on multiple test cases, we were done within 12 mins

after that he asked me if i have any questions for him and we had a good conversation within 6 mins.





Soon my another round was scheduled
#Round2 -> 23 Nov 3PM

started with the introduction, his mic wasn't working properly so there was some issue but went fine
then he started with questions, 
1. question was not straightforward but it was kind of given 2 arrays and i had to find the longest common subsequence for them, (Again, not straightforward, but easy). made me do recursive and then memoise it
2. then he asked me to print the subsequence with the maximum length

this whole thing took almost 12 mins for me to completely explain and then code and then dry run on test cases
3. Then he asked me to explain real life use of Backtracking and asked me to explain approach for N-queens problem

done in 4 mins

then he started with behavioural question
*) Have you ever learnt some skill on your own, tell me about it.
=> i used STAR method(Situation, Task, Action, Result) to answer this question and he seemed convinced.

It was almost 3.22 and then he asked me if i have any questions for him and then we again had a good convo about the work culture of amazon and the interview ended on 3.30 (30 mins tho it was for 1 hr).
