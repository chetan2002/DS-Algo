Got Rejected in this round

1 hr -> 2 FEB 2022

The Interview started with the introduction and then he gave me a DSA question based on recursion

Q) https://leetcode.com/problems/palindrome-partitioning/

Straightforward I didn't have anything in mind and told him I can implement it with recursion
and then I told him about the approach
Then while coding for Recursi
it took me 40 mins to solve the question and explain it to him

I messed up in time complexity but he was convinced with what I told him though it was wrong

then he moved to next question which was extremely hard

nearly 1 year ago, that question was in the leetcode contest and wasn't solved by many people at that time as well
Q) https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-adjacent-swaps-for-k-consecutive-ones/

I took 10 mins and came up with the approach, but I felt it was not wrong, i tried telling him but wasn't sure myself so I started thinking again
Then I tried explaining him the same approach and still wasn't confident about it

Then after 2-3 mins I told him I am getting nothing
He told me that time is up for the interview and Thanks for attending

Later when I checked the solution, The approach I was trying was almost what was needed to solve the question with some extra calculations and I feel like I did good considering the level of the question


I got rejected in the round but I lost respect for the company which has no level set for the standard of questions to be asked in the interview. I still think the question was extremely hard.
