Feb 23, 2022 -> 4PM

time: 1 hour

It wasn't actually a telephonic round, It was hosted on Hackerrank and was mostly a proper interview

Started without an introduction, there were two interviewers

Started with asking me about OOP, and almost spent 35 mins asking oops

asked, features of oop
and kept expanding in the topic

encapsulation
polymorphism, runtime-compiletime
(asked me good questions related to overloading functions ->sum(int, double) )
inheritence
abstraction -> maybe messed up explaining this


then they asked me about virtual function, and gave me a question
and i needed to write the output:

``````````````````````````````````````````
Q)
class base {
public:
	virtual void print() {
		cout<<"in base print"<<endl;
	}
	void show() {
		cout<<"in base show"<<endl;
	}

};

class derived {
public:
	void print() {
		cout<<"in derived print"<<endl;
	}
	void show() {
		cout<<"in derived show"<<endl;
	}
};

int main() {
	base b1 = new base();
	b1.print();
	b1.show();

	dervied d1 = new derived();
	d1.print();
	d1.show();

	base* b = new derived();
	b.print();
	b.show();

	derived* d = new base();
	d.print();
	d.show();
}

````````````````````````````````````````
I don't know if I did it wrong but i wasn't sure about the output i wrote

then they kept asking me more about oops

then they switched to Operating system and asked me about the Virtual Memory.

I tried explaining but they kept going in depth and I got confused and told them i am not proficient in OS

it took 42 mins till now for all this

then they gave a DSA question
````````````````````````````````
Q) Design a Data Structure for integer, which has insert, remove and contains function in O(1)
and a print function which prints all the integers in order of their insertion
``````````````````````````
-> I asked if there would be duplicates and they told me that for now we can consider that there are no duplicates

I gave the approach 
we can use a linkedlist and append in the begining
We can use a map{unordered_map<integer, Node*> to map the node with integer }
and explained the process

They then asked me more about hashing and collisions

this all took 6-7 mins and 50 mins of interview was done

then they switched to DBMS and asked about ACID Properties

I explained in details everything
then they switched back to dsa and asked a follow up of the question

```````````````````````````````
Q) consider the prev question and let's say we have duplicate insertions, but while removing them we will remove the integer occurance that was last inserted
```````````````````````````````````

I explained the approach that instead of map of Integer->Node*
we will use map of Integer->Stack<Node*>

and then they asked 
``````````````````````````+``
what if we want to remove the integer occurance which was inserted first
``````````````````````````

and I told them that we can use a queue and explained the process


Overall Interview went good.
They spent almost 45-48 mins on Core Subjects
and 10 mins approx on DSA including follow up
