The interview started with the introduction
The interviewer was very friendly and interested in knowing more about me
then he gave a very easy question:

Q) we have a box (l, b, h) and we have to calculate the length of ribbon required to wrap it
	given that length of the knot is 20m
then a follow up
Q) the knot would be the difference between length and width

Then he told me that we can move either to harder question of DSA or we can have a technical discussion

I told him that I've practiced DSA alot and it would be mostly a bad luck if I am not able to solve it and mostly wouldn't be an issue for me
and hence technical discussion would be more fun and a more learning exp

so we started discussing topics like

Multi threading vs Multiprocessing

UDP vs TCP

NoSQL vs SQL

cache 

and other basic things (and I didnt answer any of them, he told me about all of them then)
he then asked me if I were to complete my projects after knowing about these, what would i implement and after that we had a decent discussion and then the interview ended.

I asked him about the mobikwik work culture and avg day in mobikwik
