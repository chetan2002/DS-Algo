I wasn't sure about the performance in the last interview because I didn't respond well to the questions asked in the technical discussions but still got promoted to next round

The interview started with introduction and then he started asking me question on core subjects.


Interview started with a DSA question

Q) Divide the unsorted array in “k” partitions such that sum of the maximums of all the partitions is minimum.

example:
 K =2,
(6,5,4,3,2) (1)
	6     1   -> 7
[6,5,4,3,2,1]

[5, 2, 8, 1, 6] => 3


I started thinking and could only think of using recursion and so i told him that question isn't greedy and needs to address all the possible outcomes, so would need recursion initially

he told me that I am wrong and we need DP to solve the question {WHATT?? WHY WOULD YOU SAY THAT, RECURSION CAN BE MEMOISED RIGHT!!! }

then I told him that we can move to dp after we are done with recursion, and i can memoise the solution
and then I explained him the approach,
he kept interrupting me and telling me i am wrong and then used to tell same logic I told just rephrasing words. It seemed like he wasn't even listening to me and was kinda trying to solve question by himself

then I started coding and the due to my habit of asking ("is it clear to you?"), I found out that interviewer was not actually present there while I was coding because there was no response

So I completed the coding and then he came back, I then explained what I did and about the confusion I have in the base case and that I would correct it when we dry run it

He then started reading the code himself, I told him I can dry run it for him but he wasn't there to interview me I guess
then he told me about my mistake in the base case, I told him that i wasn't sure about it and wanted to fix it later

I also messed up in return condition, and then he himself corrected it and told me i wrote the wrong code

this all took 35mins approx
then we moved to core subjects

He asked me about multithreading,
Multitasking vs Multiprocessing OS,

Demand Paging and API

I explained multi tasking and multiprocessing but i think i was wrong in explaining that
then i couldn't explain demand paging and then told him about API

so I answered 50% of questions


I was expecting a rejection but still got promoted to next round;

Here is the code I wrote:


// solution
vector<vector<int>> dp;

int recursiveAnswer(vector<int> &v, int i, int k, int maxim) {
	if(i==n) {
		if(k==1) {
			return maxim;
}else {
	return -1;
}
}


if(k==0) {
	return -1;
}

maxim = max(maxim, v[i]); // maximum upto i th index

int ans = -1;
// if we partition right now
int value1 = recursiveAnswer(v, i+1, k-1, 0);	// 8
if(value1!=-1) {			
		value1 += maxim;
}
// if we include it in prev partition
int value2 = recursiveAnswer(v, i+1, k, maxim);  // -1
if(value1==-1 && value2 > 0) {
	return value2;
}
if(value2 == -1 && value1 > 0) {
	return value1;
}
return min(value1, value2);

}


int minKMaxPartition(vector<int> &v, int k) {
int n = v.size();
//dp.resize(n+1, vector<int>(k+1, -1));
return recursiveAnswer(v, 0, k, 0);
}
