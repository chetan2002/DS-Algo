Failed this round

Managerial round:
he asked about usthaan and gci and i wasn't convincing enough due to the reason i can't say and show things related to usthaan.
He asked me about load testing and i explained it really good but he wasn't convinced and I failed to answer what i used for load testing i.e. artillery.io
later he asked me a question: 
> if I have a company with 100,000 active users, how much work force do i require for customer support.
I failed to answer it properly since i lost my confidence on load testing part
