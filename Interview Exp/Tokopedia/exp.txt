# Round 1

Started with introduction, interviewer was very friendly
then came dsa question
1. Reverse a doubly linkedlist

2. then he asked what is oops and virtual function, overloading , polymorphism, friend function, etc. 
  also asked me about how the cpp would print a multiple inheritence for 2 classes with same function

then he asked if i have any questions for him and we had a conversation . Interview ended in 30 mins







# Round 2 (behavioural + technical + managerial)

started with introduction then he asked me what is my fav subject and i told him dsa
gave me a question 

Q)
	char i;
	for(i=0; i<256; i++) {
		printf("i = %d\n", i);
	}

	how many lines would be printed?
=> I was very confused if it would be 256 or infinite , I thought it had something to do with 0 being initialised to char value and if it would take ASCII or 0 value
then later i answered it wrong, he told me it would print infinite lines as char values are limited from -128 to 127 and hence won't go till 256

Q) https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-words-in-a-string/  O(N) time and O(1) space and no lib/stl function

=> I explained the approach in O(N*2) but couldn't think of O(N) approach, after trying he asked me to reverse the string and then i was able to solve the question easily

Later he asked me a few behavioural questions and about my projects, and a few OOPS based questions
and asked me why i want to join tokopedia
then he asked if i have any questions for him and then we had a convo about tokopedia and work culture
Interview ended in 30 mins
